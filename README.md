# pangram_checker
Pangram Checker is a simple Python script that checks whether a given sentence is a pangram — a sentence that contains all 26 letters of the English alphabet (a–z) at least once. This utility is useful for learning basic Python concepts such as strings, sets, and user input, and is often used in programming exercises or typing tests.
